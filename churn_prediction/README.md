# Telco Churn prediction

An exploratory data analysis and some feature engineering on a telecom customer dataset. Then in the second part of the Jupyter Notebook I execute different tree based machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will cancel anytime soon. The methods implemented are: **Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting**, and then I compared their performance against each other. (NumPy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
