# Civil War prediction using econometrics


This is a replication of an Oxford econometric study from 2004 by Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler *(Greed and grievance in civil war, Oxford Economic Papers 56, (2004), 563-595)*.  In the Jupyter Notebook I analyze the data, impute where deemed necessary, and use a class weighted **logistic regression** algorithm to predict the probability of a civil war breaking out in the following 5 year period, then analyze the most important coefficients.
